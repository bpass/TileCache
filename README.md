TileCache
=========

The purpose of this program is to display information regarding maps of different sizes.  

The required input is minimum and maximum latitude and longitude of the desired map.  Longitude is a value between -180 and +180; Latitude is a value between -90 and +90.
There are also entries for desired DPI of the map, number of levels of zoom to show, and width of each tile in pixels.  These have default values but may be set if desired.

After calculating the results, users have the option to save them in a CSV file.
